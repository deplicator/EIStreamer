==Support==
Tested to work in Internet Explorer 10 and Chrome. Does work with Internet Explorer 8, 9, and FireFox with Adobe Flash although play back may take a little longer to load.

===Use===
The Engine's of Our Inginuity is used on this project with persmission from KUHF, the University of Houston, and Dr. John Lienhard.

Permission was given with the expliciet direction this project can only pull from and parse the original website. All localization options have been removed. This code has been used for educational purposes, and can be reproduced in any form without permission from the author (although it's always a nice thing to do); however, if it is going to be used in conjuction with The Enginens of Out Ingenuity, permission should be obtained from KUHF, the University of Houston, and Dr. John Lienhard.


==Loose Time Table==
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| February || Basic website that can play episodes with cross browser support.
|-
| March || Advanced interface features; cookies and help section.
|-
|| April || Advanced back end features; get episode title, keyword support, direct link to episode.
|-

==Known bugs to work out==
* When on help or about page menu options should be disabled.
* Some characters display with ?'s.
* Some episodes have a pierod after the by line.
* Some of the pictures don't work (so far only discovered on episode 1889)


===Would be neat===
* Force image's to scale down when too wide for page. Good example in episode 2863.
* Disable view for stop button when nothing is playing.
* Have a "available in Spanish" link for episodes that have a spanish option.
* store recent episode number in file incase the site can't reach uh.edu.


==Work Log==
===March 3, 2013===
Discovered program audio is available at http://app2.kuhf.org/audio_library/engines/ and http://www.kuhf.org/programaudio/engines/. Setting up a fall back is not the worst idea.

Started working on Cookies today. I opted to use the jCookie plug in for jQuery. The site will make a cookie and append the episode number to the value after playing an episode. So far the cookie is not used for any features, like skipping episodes already played in the auto play modes.

Fixed a PHP error on line 4 of index.html by adding if(!isset($_REQUEST['epi'])).

Fixed bug '''Episode transcript link continues to add li elements''' and '''Share link url doens't work'''.

===February 24, 2013===
Fixed jPlayer playback, cleaned up code in index.html and eistreamer.js, also added a fair bit of comments to the latter. Fixed autoplay options, although it could use a better solution (currently uses javascript and not jPlayer).

Updated jPlayer aesthetics. Modified Blue Monday <http://www.jplayer.org/latest/jPlayer.Blue.Monday.2.2.0.zip> skin css to better fit layout and to have disabled previous and next buttons options.

===February 17, 2013===
Added Blue Monday skin to jPlayer, in the processes I've seemed to have broken play back. 

===February 16, 2013===
Now has cross browser support through use of jPlayer. Firefox still needs Adobe Flash because it doesn't support mp3, but it works. It's also been tested in IE10 and IE9, but doesn't work in earlier versions.

Didn't fix anything today, but I did create some sloppy code in eistreamer.js and index.php getting jPlayer to work. Add code clean up to the to do list.

===February 9, 2013===
A lot of cosmetic work today, got a great deal of the default.css figured out.

Cleaned up the left side menu. Added toggle for transcript and help, also added basic JavaScript function to swap between them in the main display area. It would be neat if this was a graphical toggle switch and if the main display area faded in and out. Will add this if time.

Simplified the auto play area, added a check box for "remembered". If checked it will make a cookie when an episode is done playing and not play that episode again on any of the auto play options. Still need to add the cookie code.

Added html for keyword and share link section. The share link code works (uses URL), but no keyword code yet. Would like to add an auto select to the share link for easier copy and paste.

Added Official info links at end of left side menu. One to the Engine's website, the other will take the user to the official Engine's transcript for the current episode.

Wrote up most of the help section, even added a bit of JavaScript to make the help section's heights match what they're describing (/scripts/help.js).

Started working on some cross browser support (all testing to this point has been Chrome). Lots of work to do here. I  also learned Firefox doesn't support MP3--who knew? Only options are third party plug-ins or converting the audio to ogg. I knew IE was going to be a problem from the beginning, but I didn't realize versions less than 10 don't seem to support the audio tag. Simple solution might be to just make it only officially support IE10.

Did some experimenting with javascript versions of play/pause. In accordance with the "don't be afraid of frameworks" learning objective I've elected to use jPlayer for cross browser support. Haven't done anything with this yet.

Started about section.

Added a footer, if I have a credit section be sure to add http://www.cssstickyfooter.com.

** Better way to handle manual input (look for comment in ieplay.js)

* mobile

** different menu on mobile browser
** change layout by screen width to fit transcript

* PHP script to get episode titles
